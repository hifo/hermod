It works!

You can open multiple tabs and type in any of them and everything gets

This even extends to formatting that isn't provided in the bar at the

sure why, it seems like the UDS sockets periodically reject
connections, among other things. I've added one HANDLER-CASE already,
and the websocket produces a lot.

There are various bugs
